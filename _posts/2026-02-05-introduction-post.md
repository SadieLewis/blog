This is my first post in this course this year, and I will be discussing my experience with this lab. The easiest part was cloning the repository of the original blog and setting it up in VSCode. I had little to no trouble with that part. My [Github][blog-github] for this project is functioning quite nicely!

On the other hand, I was wrestling against installing Jekyll and ultimately couldn't get it despite my weeklong attempt to troubleshoot the errors that kept appearing. I even went as far as to download a [C++ compiler][clang]! For the foreseeable future I will be using this blog without Jekyll, but rest assured I will still be working on it just as much! I am looking forward to seeing this blog develop and begin to look more interesting!
