***My Experience With Lab 3***

I struggled some with this lab, but most of it wasn't too bad. I enjoyed getting to work and understand the layouts, but what caused me some grief was adjusting the style. As is probably evident if you check the commits on my [Github][github], I had to make several commits to get the style to work and not break. Eventually I was able to set it to dark mode and add purple elements to the text and post headers, which I am happy with. However, the process took a long time and many more commits than I am proud of.
