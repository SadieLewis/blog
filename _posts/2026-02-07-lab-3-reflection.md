***My Experience With Lab 3***

I struggled some with this lab, but most of it wasn't too bad. I enjoyed getting to work and understand the layouts, but what caused me some grief was adjusting the style. As is probably evident if you check the commits on my [Github][github], I had to make several commits to get the style to work and not break. Eventually I was able to set it to dark mode and add purple elements to the text and post headers, which I am happy with. However, the process took a long time and many more commits than I am proud of. I added purple because it is my favorite color!

I am excited to work more with the blog and become more familiar with styling, I enjoy graphic design and I think it will be more fun when I get the hang of it! I am particularly fond of [Canva][canva], an application softwhere where you can design things like event flyers and other things utilizing graphic design! I am still a bit confused about what I did wrong on my initial mistake with css, but I'm sure I'll get it the more I practice.
