I am a 20 year old college student who is majoring in computer science at Hendrix College! I love dogs, I have two at my home in NorthWest Arkansas, and I play softball! I am also an RA for Raney Hall here on campus, so I help make and host events for residents but also help out with crises in the building when they occur!
