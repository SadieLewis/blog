Dogs are one of my favorite animals! Fun Fact about me: I almost went into animal science so I could work with dogs in some capacity! There are many breeds of dogs, but there are also categories of dogs too based on what purposes they were bred for! 

**Here is a list of the different categories of dogs:**


- Toy
- Hound
- Working
- Terrier
- Non-sporting
- Herding
