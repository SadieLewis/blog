Dogs are one of my favorite animals! Fun Fact about me: I almost went into animal science so I could work with dogs in some capacity! There are many breeds of dogs, but there are also categories of dogs too based on what purposes they were bred for! 

**Here is a list of the different categories of dogs:**


- Toy
- Hound
- Working
- Terrier
- Non-sporting
- Herding


Dogs have been great companions for a long time! My two dogs are laborador retrievers that have black coats, they are medium sized dogs but still act like they are lapdogs like toy breed dogs! They are very skilled at retrieving, even things they *may* not need to be retrieving. For example, my water bottle that still has water in it :'C. Despite this, they are part of my family and I love them very dearly. This is why I love dogs!
